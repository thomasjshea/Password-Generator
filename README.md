# Random Password Generator 

## Description

This project is a password generator created using Javascript. My motivation for building this project is my desire to be secure while browsing and interacting with services online. This project takes input criteria from the user and the output is a randomly generated password using the criteria stated by the user. This will allow the user to easily generate a password meeting the requirements for most secure websites on the internet

## Usage

To use this app, you will need to load the URL into your browser.

Please refresh the page after generating a password to clear the textbox.
